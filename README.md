# Campaign Companion


## Overview
This is a tool I developed to help TTRPG (Table-Top-Role-Playing-Game) Game-Masters keep track of the most commonly-changing elements of their ongoing games.

## Description
Within table-top-role-playing-games, the Game-Master is often responsible for far more than just running the current adventure that the other players will experience: they must also keep track of the effects that the players' actions have in broader game-world. In long-running campaigns spanning many sessions, the players are expected to have agency within the game-world to create change through their characters' actions. When campaigns can last for real-life months, or even years, it can be a lot for the Game-Master to monitor. The Campaign Companion is a tool to help with that.

The Campaign-Companion focuses on the four most common elements in TTRPGs: Non-Player-Characters, Locations, Items, and Player-Characters. There are more than these four, especially if the Game-Master is involved in world-building or creating their own adventures to run. However, these four basic elements are those that, in my experience, make up most of the "moving parts" in a campaign. They are what players are most likely to interact with, and what their actions are most likely to have lasting consequences for. They are what most frequently changes.

## Motivation
I was motivated to make this project for my own love of TTRPGs, and from my own experience with what tools I think would be useful but didn't see created by someone else. There are other, more robust systems for cataloguing large and extensive fields of notes, especially for people who write their own settings to run their games in. However, even the most user-friendly of these tools I found were too complex to navigate or use at the table during a session.

In a given moment DURING a game, I don't want to have to sift through my notes on the extensive history of the city the players are currently entering if I am just looking for the name of the magical merchant they heard about in the previous session.

The Campaign Companion is not supposed to be a repository for everything a Game-Master MIGHT need for a session: just the things they WILL need.
